# Implementation Summary: Midnight Boundary Fix

## ✅ COMPLETED

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Issue:** Time Inference Assumptions in `scraper.py`  
**Solution:** Option 1 - Day Boundary Detection (12-hour threshold)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Changes

**File:** `src/scraper.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `timedelta` import
- Enhanced `_infer_start_iso()` method with midnight boundary detection
- Added debug logging when boundary adjustment occurs

**Lines Modified:** 6, 210-236

**Key Logic:**
```python
# If parsed time is > 12 hours in the past, assume next day
time_diff = (d - now).total_seconds()
if time_diff < -12 * 3600:  # More than 12 hours in the past
    d = d + timedelta(days=1)
    logger.debug(f"Adjusted date for time '{time_text}': crossed midnight boundary")
```

### 2. Test Suite

**File:** `tests/test_midnight_boundary.py` (NEW)

**Coverage:**
- 12 unit tests covering all scenarios
- Mock-based time simulation
- Edge case validation
- Real-world scenario testing

**Results:** ✅ All 12 tests passing

**Command to run:**
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_midnight_boundary -v
```

---

### 3. Demonstration

**File:** `demo_midnight_fix.py` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Visual demonstration of the fix with before/after comparison

**Command to run:**
```bash
python demo_midnight_fix.py
```

**Output:** Shows 5 scenarios demonstrating the fix works correctly

## Impact Analysis

### Before Fix (Bug)
- **Problem:** Late-night programs (00:00-06:00) scraped after ~20:00 were dated as "today" in the past
- **Impact:** Programs excluded from time window filters
- **User Experience:** Missing movies in "now", "next2h", and "tonight" catalogs

### After Fix (Resolved)
- **Solution:** 12-hour threshold detects midnight boundary crossing
- **Impact:** Late-night programs correctly dated as "tomorrow"
- **User Experience:** All programs appear in correct time windows

### Example
```
Current Time: 23:00 (11 PM) Oct 18
Program Time: "01:30" (early morning movie)

BEFORE: Oct 18 01:30 (22 hours ago) ❌ → Filtered out
AFTER:  Oct 19 01:30 (2.5 hours ahead) ✅ → Appears in catalog
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Code implemented
2. ✅ Tests written and passing
3. ✅ Documentation complete
4. ⏭️ Ready for code review

### Deployment
1. Review changes with team
2. Merge to main branch
3. Deploy to staging (if available)
4. Monitor logs for boundary detection triggers
5. Deploy to production

### Post-Deployment
1. Monitor for "Adjusted date for time" log messages
2. Verify late-night programs appear correctly
3. Collect metrics on how often boundary detection triggers
4. Consider making threshold configurable if needed

## Commands Reference

### Run Tests
```bash
# Run all midnight boundary tests
python -m unittest tests.test_midnight_boundary -v

# Run specific test
python -m unittest tests.test_midnight_boundary.TestMidnightBoundary.test_late_night_movie_scenario -v
```

### Run Demo
```bash
python demo_midnight_fix.py
```

### Check for Errors
```bash
# Syntax check
python -m py_compile src/scraper.py

# Run the application
python -m src.main
```

## Technical Details

### Algorithm
- **Threshold:** 12 hours
- **Logic:** If `parsed_time - current_time < -12 hours`, add 1 day
- **Complexity:** O(1)
- **Performance:** Negligible overhead

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ Exactly 12 hours (not adjusted)
- ✅ Just over 12 hours (adjusted)
- ✅ Near midnight (00:00-02:00)
- ✅ Early morning (02:00-06:00)
- ✅ Daytime (unchanged)
- ✅ Single-digit hours
- ✅ No time pattern found

### Known Limitations
- Programs > 24 hours away not supported (not needed for TV guides)
- DST transitions not explicitly handled (relies on system timezone)
- Threshold is hardcoded (could be made configurable)

## Conclusion

The midnight boundary fix has been successfully implemented using Option 1 (Day Boundary Detection). The solution:

- ✅ Fixes the reported issue
- ✅ Has comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Is backward compatible
- ✅ Has no performance impact
- ✅ Is well documented

**Status:** Ready for deployment 🚀

## Author Notes

This implementation resolves the issue identified in `docs/.analysis-summary.md` as:
> **4. Midnight Boundary Bug**
>    - **Risk Level:** MEDIUM (affects late-night movies)
>    - **Impact:** Movies at 01:00 AM tomorrow show incorrect date
>    - **Current State:** `inferStartISO()` always assumes today
>    - **Mitigation:** Add day boundary detection logic

The fix has been implemented, tested, and documented according to best practices.
