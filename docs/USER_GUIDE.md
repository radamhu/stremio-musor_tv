# How to Watch Hungarian TV in Stremio

This addon shows you **what's on Hungarian TV**, but you need a **stream provider addon** to actually watch the content.

## Quick Setup (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Install This Catalog Addon

Add to Stremio:
```

```

**What you get:**

### Step 2: Install a Stream Provider Addon

You need at least one of these to actually watch content:

#### Option A: Torrentio (Recommended for most users)
```
https://torrentio.strem.fun/manifest.json
```
- ‚úÖ Free
- ‚úÖ No configuration
- ‚úÖ Works for most content
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires torrent client

#### Option B: Hungarian IPTV Addon (Best for live TV)
Look for:
- "Hungarian TV" or "Magyar TV" addons in Stremio community
- IPTV addons that include Hungarian channels
- Regional addon providers

#### Option C: Other Stream Addons
- **YouTube** - For content available on YouTube
- **Cinemeta** - Basic streams

## FAQ

### Q: Why don't I see streams when I click a movie?

**A:** You need to install stream provider addons (see Step 2 above).

This addon only shows what's on TV - it doesn't provide the actual streams. That's by design!

### Q: Which stream addon should I use?

**For Hungarian live TV:**
- Best: IPTV addon with Hungarian channels
- Alternative: Record/save content and watch later via Torrentio

**For Hungarian movies:**
- Torrentio usually has good coverage
- YouTube addon for some content

### Q: Can this addon provide streams directly?

**A:** Technically yes, but we chose not to because:
- ‚úÖ You already have stream addons installed
- ‚úÖ They work better than we could build
- ‚úÖ Keeps legal responsibility clear
- ‚úÖ Follows Stremio's design principles

### Q: I have streams installed but still nothing shows

**Possible causes:**
1. Stream addon doesn't have that specific content
2. Title mismatch (different names in different databases)
3. Stream addon needs configuration

**Try:**
- Install another stream addon for more options
- Check if the movie title is correct
- Search manually in your stream addon

### Q: Do I need to pay for anything?

**This addon:** Free, open source

**Stream addons:** Depends which you choose
- Torrentio: Free
- IPTV addons: Usually require subscription
- YouTube: Free

## Recommended Setup

For best Hungarian TV experience:

```
1. This addon (catalog)
   + Torrentio (general content)
   + Hungarian IPTV addon (live TV)
   = Complete solution!
```

## Troubleshooting

### No streams available

1. Check you have stream addons installed
2. Go to Stremio Settings ‚Üí Addons
3. You should see addons with "stream" capability
4. If not, install Torrentio at minimum

### Wrong content shows up

Sometimes stream addons match by title and might get it wrong. Try:
- Different stream addon
- Manual search
- Check movie details before playing

### Poor quality streams

- Install more stream addons for more options
- Premium IPTV usually has better quality
- Torrentio: higher seeds = better quality

## Best Practices

1. **Install multiple stream addons** - More options = better coverage
2. **Keep addons updated** - Stream sources change
3. **Use IPTV for live TV** - Better than VOD for current programming
4. **Browse, don't search** - Catalog browsing works best for "what's on now"

## Support

**For catalog issues** (addon not showing movies, wrong times, etc.):
- Check addon logs
- Report on GitHub

**For streaming issues** (no streams, won't play, etc.):
- Check your stream addon's documentation
- Not this addon's responsibility

## Summary

‚úÖ **This addon** = Shows what's on Hungarian TV  
‚úÖ **Stream addons** = Let you watch it

Together = Complete Stremio experience! üé¨
